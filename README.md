# <a name="about"></a> About FreeKernelJS
FreeKernelJS aims to provide developers with a set of tools to produce a Web application structured from a Template, and to use common tasks in development such as: testing the application, generate documentation, produce a distribution version, and more.

To accelerate the production of the applications FreeKernelJS uses a Generator, which also makes the entire process simple and easy to use.  
FreeKernelJS Generator creates for you a work environment - the Workspace, a separate Web project for each application, and enables you to develop custom Templates and Themes, then - import them into FreeKernelJS to be operated by its Generator.

##### FreeKernelJS is based on these technologies:

# <a name="getting-started"></a> Getting Started
1. **[Concept And Terminology]()**: understand the main concept behind FreeKernelJS and learn about its terminology.
2. **[Installation](https://github.com/FreeKernelJS/generator-freekerneljs/wiki/installation)**: first, you will need to install the environment with only 4 easy steps!
3. **[Generate and Manage New Projects](https://github.com/FreeKernelJS/generator-freekerneljs/wiki/generate-app)**: then you can learn how to generate a new Project, how to configure and manage it. 

# <a name="templates"></a> Templates
FreeKernelJS offers a collection of Templates from which you can choose.  
Each Template contains different features and UI libraries, and can be used to generate an App.  
A list of available Templates is specified on this page: **[Templates](https://github.com/FreeKernelJS/generator-freekerneljs/wiki/templates)**.  
In addition, you can enlarge your collection of Templates by **[Creating a Custom Template](https://github.com/FreeKernelJS/generator-freekerneljs/wiki/templates#custom)** yourself.

# <a name="themes"></a> Themes
Each App that FreeKernelJS generates can use a single Theme.  
You can use the default Theme that comes built-in with the Template you choose, or create your own custom Theme and use it in your application.  
To learn how to do that read [Creating a Custom Theme]().

# <a name="development"></a> Development Tools
FreeKernelJS comes with a set of tasks, powered by Grunt, which can be used during development to perform routine operations such as: unit testing, distribution, Sass compilation, etc.  
A list of available tasks and instructions on how to use them can be found on this page: **[Use Grunt Tasks in Development](https://github.com/FreeKernelJS/generator-freekerneljs/wiki/grunt-tasks)**
